## Project Overview

NFT-Receipt is a solution that helps provides ownshipership of products between buyers and sellers in a p2p second-hand marketplace. The use of these marketplace is ever increasing as alot of people tends to change devices or car for better options. As this is an already exiting marketplace in the web2 space adding this feature can bring more penetration to users to care more about the ownership of what they buy and expose them to be power of web3 technology. 

We are targeting the everyone starting with the Africa community as we can see the increasing trends of fairly useds item been purchased

## Problem Statement and solution

The problem most second-hand marketplace face is no issuance of receipt after a product is bought or no proper ownership of the product bought the the issued receipt do not carry the identity of the new buyer because the new buyer is not the initial/original buyer, but with this solution transferable ownership NFT receipt buyers can get the satisfaction of having a sense of ownership for the product bought without facing challenges of being harassed about your goods. This inspiration came as a result of the experience I had few month back when I got a smartphone and it was from a second-hand [marketplace](https://jiji.ng/). I was issued a receipt but it does not tally with my identity and I can’t use it because I don’t have a proof of ownership. This brought about this idea of making a transferable nft receipt to help people like me derive complete satisfaction and zero worries about the items they purchase from second-hand marketplaces.

## How it will be built

This will be a dApp that will leverage the Algorand blockchain and the technology around it. Since it involves minting of receipts of products to be sold and transfering the ownership to another buyer and so on. We will make use of this technologies algorand blockchain, wallet connector, PyTeal, PureStake API, React, Nodejs, Pinata, IPFS

Connecting to a wallet is one important requirements most DApp developers will have to integrate in their application when creating a DApp on the Algorand Blockchain.
